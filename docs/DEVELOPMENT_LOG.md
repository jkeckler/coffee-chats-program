## Session Update (January 14, 2025)

### Matching Logic Implementation
**Situation:** Needed to develop core matching logic for coffee chat groups
**Task:** Create system to form valid groups and assign captains based on time zone availability
**Action:** 
- Implemented CoffeeGroup class with:
  - Time zone conversion
  - Overlapping hours detection
  - Captain assignment logic
  - Previous captain tracking
**Result:** Working prototype that can:
  - Form groups of 2-3 people
  - Convert and validate overlapping hours across time zones
  - Avoid assigning back-to-back captains
  - Generate helpful captain messages with local meeting times

### Next Steps
1. Connect matching logic to Excel data
2. Implement full group formation for all participants
3. Consider future enhancements:
   - SQL database for captain history
   - More sophisticated time zone handling
   - Department mixing optimization
